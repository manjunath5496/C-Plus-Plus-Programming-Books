<p><strong>C++</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a title="General-purpose programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language">general-purpose programming language</a>&nbsp;created by&nbsp;<a title="Bjarne Stroustrup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>&nbsp;as an extension of the&nbsp;<a title="C (programming language)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C programming language</a>, or "C with&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Class (programming)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(programming)">Classes</a>". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has&nbsp;<a title="Object-oriented programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Generic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generic</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Functional programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a>&nbsp;features in addition to facilities for&nbsp;<a title="Low-level programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">low-level</a>&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Memory (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computing)">memory</a>&nbsp;manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a&nbsp;<a title="Compiled language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language">compiled language</a>, and many vendors provide&nbsp;<a title="List of compilers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C.2B.2B_compilers">C++ compilers</a>, including the&nbsp;<a title="Free Software Foundation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation">Free Software Foundation</a>,&nbsp;<a title="LLVM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM">LLVM</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Microsoft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Intel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel">Intel</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Oracle Developer Studio" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Developer_Studio">Oracle</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="IBM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a>, so it is available on many platforms.</p>
<p>C++ was designed with a bias toward&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="System programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming">system programming</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Embedded software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software">embedded</a>, resource-constrained software and large systems, with&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Performance (software)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_(software)">performance</a>, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.&nbsp;C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,&nbsp;including&nbsp;<a title="Application software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">desktop applications</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Server (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">servers</a>&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;<a title="E-commerce" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce">e-commerce</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Web search engine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">Web search</a>, or&nbsp;<a title="SQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>&nbsp;servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Telephone switches" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_switches">telephone switches</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Space probes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probes">space probes</a>).</p>
<p>C++ is standardized by the&nbsp;<a title="International Organization for Standardization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a>&nbsp;(ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization"><em>ISO/IEC 14882:2017</em></a>&nbsp;(informally known as&nbsp;<a title="C++17" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17">C++17</a>).&nbsp;The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as&nbsp;<em>ISO/IEC 14882:1998</em>, which was then amended by the&nbsp;<a title="C++03" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B03">C++03</a>,&nbsp;<a title="C++11" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++11</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="C++14" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14">C++14</a>&nbsp;standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standard_library">standard library</a>. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist&nbsp;<a title="Bjarne Stroustrup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a title="Bell Labs" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a>&nbsp;since 1979 as an extension of the&nbsp;<a title="C (programming language)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C language</a>; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided&nbsp;<a title="High-level programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-level features</a>&nbsp;for program organization.&nbsp;<a title="C++20" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B20">C++20</a>&nbsp;is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.</p>
